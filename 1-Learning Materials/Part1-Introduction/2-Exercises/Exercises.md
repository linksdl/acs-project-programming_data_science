## Exercises


To do the exercises you need to download the Jupyter notebook file (with extension .ipynb) and load it into Jupter. Full instructions and additional information are included with the notebook files. A 'View' link (to a HTML page) is also provided, if you just want to have a look at the file without opening it in Jupyter. (But do not try using the HTML file to do the exercise!)
