    "# Object Oriented Vending Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we implement a vending machine as a Object Oriented program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the functionality is identical to the non-object oriented version\n",
    "the OO implementation gives us a rather different way of looking at the\n",
    "program. Each item in the machine can be regarded as an object, and the\n",
    "vending machine is itself a complex object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have the possibility of using the same `Item`s in different code\n",
    "modules, for instance they could be available in stores, produced by\n",
    "factories and transported by trucks. In a more general context we may need\n",
    "to think more about what the item is, in particular what are its essential\n",
    "features and what might vary (e.g. it may cost more when bought from a \n",
    "vending machine that from a shop).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility would be to create multiple vending machines, and\n",
    "perhaps embed them in an object-oreiented model of an environment (e.g.\n",
    "a shopping centre or university campus).\n",
    "\n",
    "For richer and more realistic simulation we would not abstract the environment\n",
    "of the vending machine just in terms of _footfall_. Instead, we would actually\n",
    "model people as objects, which move around the environment. "

    "### Modelling instances of a type in an OO framework\n",
    "OO Programming gives us the idea of a `class` and an `object` being an instance\n",
    "of a `class`. Many programmers (even OOP text book writers) seem to believe, or\n",
    "give the impression that this solves the problem of dealing, in a program, of\n",
    "multiple instances of the same kind of thing. But actually many complications\n",
    "and modelling choices remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a library that stocks many books. It seems clear that if we want to\n",
    "write a program to provide useful functionality for running the library, a \n",
    "`Book` class may be useful. Objects of the `Book` class would then have\n",
    "attributes storing the `title` and `author` the book. \n",
    "Perhaps the library has in its collection a \n",
    "book called _Programming for Eejits_. We may code this by creating an\n",
    "object that is an instance of the class `Book`, and whose `title` attribute\n",

    "The vending machine has a similar issue with multiple individual items of the\n",
    "same type, and also multiple types of item. In my code I have modelled the\n",
    "situation by treating each item type an an object, and modelling the contents\n",
    "of the machine by a list of `StockEntry` objects. Each `StockEntry` object\n",
    "consists of an item type together with the number of that object that\n",
    "are in the machine. This seems to work well for this particular simulation, but\n",
    "I am not sure if it is the best representation."
