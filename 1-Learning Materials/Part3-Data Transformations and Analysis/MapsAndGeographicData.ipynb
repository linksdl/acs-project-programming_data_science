    "   # Maps and Visualisation of Geographically Located Data\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In this lesson we shall look at the use of maps and geographically located data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Data with a geographic component is of huge importance in many types of\n",
    "   investigation, and is relevant to  commercial and  social\n",
    "   as well as enviromental applications.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Certain types of data are intrinsically geographical, in the sense that they\n",
    "   directly describe the spatial and material structure of the world. This includes\n",
    "   data regarding the actual shape of the earth's surface, its land-masses, oceans,\n",
    "   mountains, valleys and plains. It also includes information about land type and\n",
    "   land use and specific geographic objects: deserts, forests, orchards, buildings \n",
    "   and cities. And we may also include regions that are defined by human conventions\n",
    "   and legislation, such as countries, counties and national parks.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   But there are many more kinds of data that, though not in themselves geographic,\n",
    "   are linked to geographic locations --- for example, average temperatures or\n",
    "   rainfall, populations of cities or countries, house prices, average incomes,\n",
    "   crime levels, internet addresses. And we can often get insight into data by\n",
    "   investigating its correspondence with geographic location. Linking data\n",
    "   with geographic location immidiately provides a way to view it in terms of\n",
    "   its distribution in space, and in particular in relation to a familiar map\n",
    "   of our country or our world. This may reveal patterns\n",
    "   in the data that were impossible to see by looking at tables of numbers.\n",
    "   Futhermore, if we  have two different types of data that are not intrinsically\n",
    "   geographical but both are linked to geographic locations, we can use this\n",
    "   to identify correlations that are only apparent when we consider \n",
    "   their spatial distribution. \n",

    "## Map Visualisation in Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many packages that provide ways of visualising maps and geographically\n",
    "located data in Jupyter. Some of the most commonly used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`geopandas`](https://geopandas.org/)\n",
    "* [`plotly` with `mapbox`](https://plotly.com/python/maps/)\n",
    "* [`folium`](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/)\n",
    "* [`kepler.gl`](https://kepler.gl/)\n",
    "* [`geoviews`](https://geoviews.org/)\n",
    "* [`ipyleaflet`](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n",
    "\n",
    "These all provide ways of displaying maps and adding graphics derived from data\n",
    "to map displays. Most of them also provide various ways that you can interact\n",
    "with the map data, such as panning, zooming, selecting and drawing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one we shall look at in this module is `ipyleaflet`. \n",
    "(The link in the list above will take you to the documentation.) Probably other\n",
    "choices will be more suitable in different cases, depending on what kind\n",
    "of mapping and map functionality you need. But `ipyleaflet` is fairly\n",
    "easy to use and comes with a convenient map of the world, which is\n",
    "can be zoomed in and out show any scale from the whole world to a \n",
    "street map.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Installing `ipyleaflet`\n",
    "\n",
    "`ipyleaflet` should be very easy to install as long as you have a recent\n",
    "version of Anaconda. (At the time of writing, the latest version of the full Anaconda3\n",
    "install was July 2020, so any version more recent than that should be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If using `conda` for package updates it is probably best to run it in a shell window.\n",
    "  Under Linux, the `conda` program should be at `anaconda3/bin/conda` (The location of\n",
    "  the `anaconda3` directory will depend on how you installed it.)\n",
    "  In Windows you should have __Anaconda Prompt__ available by command search at the\n",
    "  start menu. From there you can run `conda` commands.\n",
    "  * (optional) `conda update --all`\n",
    "  * `conda install -c conda-forge ipyleaflet`\n",
    "  \n",
    "* If using `pip`, you probably just need to do `pip install ipyleaflet` or\n",
    "  possibly `pip3 install ipyleaflet` (You normally only need to use `pip3` if your\n",
    "  main version of `pip` is for Python2. This which can be the case on systems\n",
    "  which have Python2 built in as well as having Python3 installed afterwards.)\n",
    "\n",
