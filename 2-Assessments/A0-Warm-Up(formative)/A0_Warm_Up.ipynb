    "## P4DS: Assignment 0 (formative) (Autumn 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Warm Up\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Last modified: 7th Oct, 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This formative coursework has the following objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* to illustrate and develop skills of basic Python programming \n",
    "* to help you get used to coding in the Jupyter environment\n",
    "  using this kind of coursework specification format, in which\n",
    "  the instructions and your answers are given in the same notebook file\n",
    "* to show you the semi-automated program testing and grading systems\n",
    "  that will be used for the assignments on this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work will consist of defining a number of functions according to given specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given a bare skeleton function just giving the function name, arguments and a dummy return value. To answer the questions you need to fill in code within thes\n",
    "template functions in order to create a working function that fulfils the\n",
    "given requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatic Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to check that your functions are working correctly, by running a testing function defined in the Python file `A0_Warm_Up_tests.py`. You should download this and put it in the same directory as this file (`A0_Warm_Up.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a href=\"http://teaching.bb-ai.net/P4DS/assignments/A0_Warm_Up_tests.py\" download>\n",
    "    A0_Warm_Up_tests.py</a>\n",
    "    \n",
    "An example question is given below, with an explanation of how to answer it and test your answer. After that are 3 questions you need to answer yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Grading and Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "This is formative coursework which means that the mark\n",
    "you obtain does not count towards your\n",
    "module grade. Hence there is no submission deadline.\n",
    "However, an autograding submission system will be made availble\n",
    "via Gradescope. \n",
    "You are strongly advised to try this as it\n",
    "will enable you (and me) to test the submission and autograding\n",
    "system, to ensure it works smoothly for later assessments (which\n",
    "will count towards your grade).\n",
    "You will receive a notification when the Gradescope submission\n",
    "system is ready for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this file a Grading section, which provides a\n",
    "function for carrying out grading of all parts of the assignment\n",
    "and calculating a final grade. This should indicate the\n",
    "grade you are likely to obtain by submitting the file to\n",
    "Gradescope, which will carry out similar testing.\n",
    "But note that *the gradescope automarker will carry out\n",
    "different specific tests than those provided in `A0_Warm_Up_tests.py`\n",
    "for your own testing*. It will check your functions using\n",
    "different input values."
