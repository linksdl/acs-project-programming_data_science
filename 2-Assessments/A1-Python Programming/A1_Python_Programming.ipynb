    "This coursework is intended to develop and test skills in defining basic algorithmic functions in Python, with an emphasis on types of function for processing, transforming and classifying. Completing this set of tasks should give you a very good\n",
    "grounding in the fundamental programming techiniques required for DataScience.\n",
    "\n",

    "wrong type (such as a number instead of a string) or names of files that\n",
    "do not exist. It is not that kind of programming course.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to check that your functions are working correctly, by running a testing function defined in the Python file `A1_Python_Programming_tests.py`. You should download this and put it in the same directory as this file (`A1_Python_Programming.ipynb`).\n",
