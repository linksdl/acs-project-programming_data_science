    "This coursework is intended to develop and test skills in defining basic algorithmic functions in Python, with an emphasis on types of function for processing, transforming and classifying. Completing this set of tasks should give you a very good\n",
    "grounding in the fundamental programming techiniques required for DataScience.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we are only using a limited set of library modules. This is to\n",
    "ensure you master the kinds of algorithms required rather than relying on\n",

    "In other words do not add `import` statements in any code you write\n",

    "### Form of the Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Your work will consist of defining a number of functions according to given specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given a bare skeleton function just giving the function name, arguments and a dummy return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to edit the functions so that for any input of the expected type, the\n",
    "result returned will fit the given specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the grading I will **not** try to catch you out by giving inputs of the\n",
    "wrong type (such as a number instead of a string) or names of files that\n",
    "do not exist. It is not that kind of programming course.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to check that your functions are working correctly, by running a testing function defined in the Python file `A1_Python_Programming_tests.py`. You should download this and put it in the same directory as this file (`A1_Python_Programming.ipynb`).\n",

    "When answering the questions below, you can just modify the given template cell. You don't need to create a new cell for your definition. But make sure you do not alter the name of the function or the number and type of its arguments, otherwise the automatic testing/grading function will not work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please look at the prelimiary formative assignment notebook `A0_Warm_Up.ipynb` for further explanation\n",
