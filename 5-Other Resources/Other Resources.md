### Other Resources

A further large set of Python materials and videos are available from the [Programming for the Web](https://soc-dm.leeds.ac.uk/module/) website, which was my previous Python programming module. That module is a bit different because it does not use Jupyter (the demo videos use the Spyder environment for Python coding, which also comes with Anaconda).
